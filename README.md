# Canvas Snake

An implementation of the Snake arcade game in pure Javascript (using canvas for
rendering).

## Notes

Lacking formal rules or a standard game to directly clone I've largely just made
things up.

Will eventually have things like walls, bad blocks, scores.

There is a working copy up at http://splat.or.at.
